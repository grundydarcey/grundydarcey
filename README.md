Hi there! :wave:<hr />

My name is Darcey. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Phoenix, Arizona. I like music, cooking, reality TV and finishing side projects.

<ul>
    <li>:star2: My favorite part of development is knowing that no task is really impossible, just not fully fleshed yet.</li><br />
    <li>:boom: In a world of no/low documentation, I pride myself on being able to self-teach and get up to speed quickly on unfamiliar projects.</li><br />
    <li>:gem: I love adding new technologies to my toolbelt.</li>
</ul>
