Hi there! My name is Darcey. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Tampa, Florida. I enjoy overloading my brain everyday. ðŸ¤“

Currently working on transitioning my small business from Etsy to it's own platform and learning more and more about ecommerce than ever. If you have any tips or resources, feel free to send them my way!

Feel free to take a look around at some of my projects or <a href='https://www.hiredarcey.com' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>visit my portfolio!</a>
