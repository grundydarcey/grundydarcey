Hi there! :wave:

My name is Darcey. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Phoenix, Arizona. I like music, cooking, reality TV and finishing side projects.

:star2: My favorite part of development is knowing that no task is really impossible.


Feel free to take a look around at some of my projects!</a>
