Hi there! My name is Darcey. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Tampa, Florida. I enjoy overloading my brain everyday. ðŸ¤“

Currently working on...
* transitioning my small business from Etsy to it's own platform
* learning Java (shoutout SkillStorm!) and strengthening my familiarity with OOP
* learning Vue.js

Feel free to take a look around at some of my projects or <a href='https://www.hiredarcey.com' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>visit my portfolio!</a>
