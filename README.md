Hi there! :wave:<hr />

My name is Darcey. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Phoenix, Arizona. I like music, cooking, reality TV and finishing side projects.


:star2: My favorite part of development is knowing that no task is really impossible, just not fully fleshed yet.<br />
:boom: In a world of no/low documentation, I pride myself on being able to self-teach and get up to speed quickly on unfamiliar projects.<br />
:gem: I love adding new technologies to my toolbelt.


Feel free to take a look around at some of my projects!</a>
